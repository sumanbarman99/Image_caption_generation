# Image Caption Generation Project

Welcome to the Image Caption Generation project! This project focuses on generating captions for images using a deep learning architecture. The project utilizes two main inputs: the VGG16 model for extracting image features and a sequence feature model that includes embedded captions and an LSTM for processing captions. The decoder model combines both inputs to generate matching captions for the given images.

## Introduction

The Image Caption Generation project aims to generate descriptive captions for images using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The model takes advantage of two input sources: VGG16 for image feature extraction and a sequence feature model that includes embedded captions and an LSTM for processing sequential information.

## Model Architecture

### Input 1: Image Feature Extraction

The first input employs the VGG16 model to extract high-level features from input images. These features serve as the foundation for generating meaningful captions.

### Input 2: Sequence Feature Model

The second input involves a sequence feature model. This model includes an embedding layer to convert caption words into dense vectors and an LSTM layer to process sequential information in captions.

### Decoder Model

The decoder model combines the features extracted from both inputs to generate captions. The architecture employs techniques such as attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the image during the caption generation process.
